	<h1>Lab 3: File Structures</h1>
	<p>The idea of this lab was to further create a local file structure
		on my computer and add index.html files. I was also instructed to
		add an image of myself as well as create a bulleted list that links to each
		of my other labs.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>Installing and using the file structure wasn't too hard. Overall, I
			would say my biggest challenge was finding the file path to upload my
			selfie picture. I realized that I could actually just drag and drop the
			image to img folder instead of trying to locate the exact file path.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>This is my index.html file for Lab 3. Below is a screenshot of my
				finished file structure:</p>
